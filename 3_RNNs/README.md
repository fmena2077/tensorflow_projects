This folder contains scripts with examples of RNN applications

- RNN example - predict 10 time steps.py: A model predicting the next 10 time steps in a time series

In the folder Audio Example:

- RNN_Audio_CleaningData.py: Script that cleans the data in Paper3_WebData_Final.csv. Instructions of the 
example appear in the "Instructs" files


- RNN_Audio_Training.py: RNN model that predicts the missing frequencies


- RNN_Audio_CleaningData_4TF.py: Script that prepares the data to be used with tf.data format


- RNN_Audio_Training_withTFdata_v2.py: Script that trains the model using the tf.data format (ideal for large datasets)
