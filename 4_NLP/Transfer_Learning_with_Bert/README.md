# Transfer Learning with Bert for Text Classification

## Saturdays AI - Green Team project

This project uses Bert and transfer learning to train a model to classify social media/chat conversations, 
and a simple implementation using streamlit. 
The two classes are normal conversations and dangerous conversations.

* Transfer_learning_with_Bert.py: Script that trains the model

* abbreviations.json: dictionary with common abbreviations to use for data cleaning

* streamlit_test.py: Simple implementation of the model using streamlit
